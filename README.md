# Setting up environment

1. Install globally: (to be honest I am not sure whether the cli is also needed to run the project)

```javascript
npm install -g react-native-cli@2.0.1
npm install -g react-native@0.55.3
```
2. Enable USB debugging in the developer options on your **android** phone, and connect it
3. The connection type should be USB debugging
4. cd into moody, make sure that your project path doesn't contain any non-ascii characters
5. Run the following commands:
```javascript
npm install 
npm run android
```
6. If everything was successful, you should see the app working on your phone. 
7. Shake your phone, and in the appearing options tap "Enable hot loading".
8. (OPTIONAL) Enable the option on developer options to never shut down the screen.
ENJOY
